I'm Hernán, a researcher at the Biomedical Imaging Center at [Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile](https://www.uc.cl/).  I'm a Ph.D.(c) in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging with a background in Civil Engineering, and with some expertise in applied continuum mechanics, finite elements method, and programming to solve biomechanical problems. I have a particular interest on the complex mechanics of the heart and how this organ is affected by diseases, and my thesis work is focussed on the development of acquisition and processing techniques to understand the dynamic behavior of the heart.

Most of my previous work has been related to the simulation of the wave propagation phenomena on unbounded domains with geophysical applications. Using [FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org/) and [FreeFem++](https://freefem.org/), I solved the elastodynamics equations using an absorbing boundary layer (PML) to dissipate outgoing energy. As side research to my Ph.D., I'm working on developing a numerical framework to solve the site characterization problem efficiently using seismogram measurements. This last work is being developed jointly with people from the [Structural and Geotechnical](https://www.ing.uc.cl/estructural-y-geotecnica/) and  [Mathematical Engineering](http://imc.uc.cl/) departments at PUC.
