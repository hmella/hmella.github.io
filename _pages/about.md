I'm Hernán, a researcher at the Biomedical Imaging Center at [Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile](https://www.uc.cl/).  I'm a Ph.D.(c) in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging with a background in Civil Engineering, and with some expertise in applied continuum mechanics, finite elements method, and programming to solve biomechanical problems. I have a particular interest on the complex mechanics of the heart and how this organ is affected by diseases, and my thesis work is focussed on the development of acquisition and processing techniques to understand the dynamic behavior of the heart.

In the postprocessing part of my Ph.D. thesis I developed an Harmonic Phase Interpolation Method (HARPI) to estimate motion from tagging MRI. HARPI is based on the same principles as HARP and SinMod, but has more robustness to noise and does not depend on temporal resolution. In the acquisition part, I developed the Phase Complementary Spatial Modulation of Magnetization (PCSPAMM) acquisition sequence, which allows the simultaneous measurement of displacement and velocity fields in the tissue through the whole cardiac cycle. With PCSPAMM, a CSPAMM and a Phase Contrast image are retrieved from the same acquisition, which reduces the acquisition time in a half.

Most of my previous work has been related to the simulation of the wave propagation phenomena on unbounded domains with geophysical applications. Using [FEniCS](https://fenicsproject.org/) and [FreeFem++](https://freefem.org/), I solved the elastodynamics equations using an absorbing boundary layer (PML) to dissipate outgoing energy. As side research to my Ph.D., I'm working on developing a numerical framework to solve the site characterization problem efficiently using seismogram measurements. This last work is being developed jointly with people from the [Structural and Geotechnical](https://www.ing.uc.cl/estructural-y-geotecnica/) and  [Mathematical Engineering](http://imc.uc.cl/) departments at PUC.
